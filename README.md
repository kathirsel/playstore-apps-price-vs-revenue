Percentage of Free Apps: The percentage of free apps on the Google Play Store was calculated. This information can be useful for understanding the competitive landscape of the app market.
Most Expensive App: The most expensive app on the Google Play Store was identified. This can provide an understanding of the upper limit of app pricing on the platform.
Outcome: By completing these tasks, youâ€™ve successfully conducted a thorough analysis of the apps on the Google Play Store and derived valuable insights. These insights can be incredibly useful for app developers, marketers, and strategists in making informed decisions..
